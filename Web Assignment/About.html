                <h1> About Us</h1>
                <p>Just one hand reaching over the counter to give a cup to another outstretched hand captures this fleeting moment in time.
                    It is a link, though.
                    From our dedication to providing the best coffee in the world to the way we interact with our clients and communities to do business ethically,
                    we make sure that everything we do respects that relationship.
                    Since opening our first location as a single store almost 40 years ago,
                    we have made an effort to improve every place we visit and go from where we started.</p>
                <h4>Our History</h4>
                    <p>It still holds true now as it did when the original Café Amour opened its doors in 1981
                        The business operated a single location in the famed Pike Place Market in Paris back then.
                        Café Amour started off as a little storefront selling some of the best fresh-roasted whole bean coffee in the world.
                        The name suggested the romanticism of the high seas and the maritime history of the early coffee traders, 
                        and it was inspired by the original owner's grandmother, who loved coffee just as much as her husband.
                        Café Amour always intended to be a different kind of business. One that fostered a sense of community in addition to honoring coffee and its long history.
                        With more than 32,000 locations in 80 countries,
                        Café Amour is currently the world's leading specialty coffee roaster and retailer.
                        Additionally, we work hard to capture an amazing experience and our legacy in every cup.</p>
                <h5>The Mission of Café Amour</h5>
                        <p>One neighbor, one cup, and one person at a time, to uplift and nourish the human spirit.</p> 
                <h6>The Principles of Café Amour</h6>
                        <p>At our core, we live by these ideals, with our partners, coffee, and consumers at our center:<br>
                            <i><b>Fostering an environment where everyone is accepted and feels warmly welcomed.
                            bravely taking action, questioning the existing quo, and coming up with fresh ideas to advance both our business and one another.
                            demonstrating openness, decency, and respect while being present.</b></i></p>
